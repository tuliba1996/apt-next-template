## Getting Started

### Code Generator Plugin:
You can download the `protoc-gen-grpc-web` protoc plugin from our
[release](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web/releases) page:

If you don't already have `protoc` installed, you will have to download it
first from [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-javascript/releases).

> **NOTE:** Javascript output is no longer supported by `protocolbuffers/protobuf` package as it previously did. Please use the releases from [protocolbuffers/protobuf-javascript](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-javascript/releases) instead.

Make sure they are both executable and are discoverable from your PATH.

For example, in MacOS, you can do:

```
$ sudo mv ~/Downloads/protoc-gen-grpc-web-1.4.2-darwin-x86_64 \
    /usr/local/bin/protoc-gen-grpc-web
$ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/protoc-gen-grpc-web
```

### Client Configuration Options

Typically, you will run the following command to generate the proto messages
and the service client stub from your `.proto` definitions:

```sh
$ protoc -I=$DIR echo.grpc \
    --js_out=import_style=commonjs:$OUT_DIR \
    --grpc-web_out=import_style=commonjs,mode=grpcwebtext:$OUT_DIR
```

You can then use Browserify, Webpack, Closure Compiler, etc. to resolve imports
at compile time.

#### Generated Code with buf

Install buf

```bash
# install buf
brew install bufbuild/buf/buf

# check version buf
buf version
```

```bash
cd src/grpc
buf generate
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
